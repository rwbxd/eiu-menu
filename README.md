# EIU Menu
An Alexa skill that scrapes https://www.eiu.edu/dining/dining_menu.php to pull and read off the menu for today's lunch or dinner (depending on user's input) at the inputted hall.

## Usage
The user asks an Alexa-enable device to "Ask EIU menu what's for (lunch or dinner) at (hall of their choosing)"
It then scrapes the menu for that hall and meal, and reads it back.
